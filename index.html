        <p><em>CS grad student at <strong><a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a></strong></em></p>
        <br>
        <p>A graduate student at University of Southern California, I’m pursuing my Masters in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>
          I have industry experience as a software test engineer, developing automation frameworks in Java for full stack software systems that include android and iOS mobile applications and desktop and mobile web applications. This gives me a
          strong hold
          on algorithm design and analysis, data structures and object oriented programming. As an added interest, I have also contributed to iOS application development using Swift for my previous company as well as for side projects. </p>
        <p>
          I am now preparing to move into software development after completing my Master's in CS at University of Southern California. I believe I can bring the unique perspective of a tester to software development. Such as analyzing the
          requirements of
          a product and being able to come up with edge cases that could break the system in production, viewing the system as an end-to-end integration instead of a niche feature to be developed, playing the role of an end user to identify any user
          experience shortcomings of the product and so on. </p>
        <p>
          My latest work experience was at Paytm - India’s leading payments company. The product that I built caters to an average of 1.3 bn transactions daily. The automation framework I designed and developed reduced the manual effort time
          estimation by
          60% thus driving code faster to production while maintaining the high quality of the product features. I spent around 50% of my time coding and the other 50% was spent in manual testing, writing test plans, reviewing test cases, improving
          QA
          processes, leading multiple testing efforts, providing deployment and post production support holding sprint planning meetings etc. </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working in Agile teams with high velocity release cycles. The experience has taught me to solve complex problems with minimal supervision and ambiguous requirements. I also honed the ability to work closely with developers, business
          analysts, product managers and other business stakeholders in cross functional teams. Leading, mentoring and hiring the QA team for Paytm gave me leadership experience which built my communication and collaboration skills. Also giving me a
          chance
          for innovating practices to prioritize product quality and customer experience.</p>
